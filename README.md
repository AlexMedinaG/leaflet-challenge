# leaflet-challenge
 
For this challenge I built an Earthquake Visualization page by using the United States Geological Survey data from the last 7 days.

I used leaflet in order to display a map and mark the coordinates for each earthquake, with the size of each marker being the Magnitude and the color representing the origin Depth (also added two legend to make a user easier to comprehend). Lastly a popup provides more information for each marker with the: location, time, type, magnitude and depth.
